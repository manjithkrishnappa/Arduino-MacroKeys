# Arduino-MacroKeys
Macro keys using the arduino development board


This project uses the Arduino Leonardo board along with a USB host shield. An additional keyboard can be attached to the USB shield.
A keypressed on the additonal keyboard can be intercepted and other key presses can be simulated and sent to the host computer that the arduino is connected to using micro usb cable.
